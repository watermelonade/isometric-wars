# isometric-wars

  Isometric Wars is a side project that I'm working on to practice game development and learn Unity3D. When it is finished, it'll be a turn-based isometric strategy game that incorporates tile-based movement and shooter elements. 
  
  List of implemented features:
    * Map generation
    * Player and enemy turns
    * Player movement AI
    * Camera rotation about the map
    
    
  List of partially implemented features:
    * Enemy AI
      * reward function needs tweaking, attacks too often.

  List of features to be implemented:
   * Menus
     * pause menu
     * main menu
   * Saving.
