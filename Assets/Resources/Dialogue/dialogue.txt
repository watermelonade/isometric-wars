[Scene inside of hovertank]

Abel: Great news. Skies are clear, and we're right in the open.
Cornelia: How many behind us?
Abel: One big cannon, aiming right this way to blow us to kingdom come.
Cornelia: Why don't you fire back, then?
Abel: Then they'll catch up to us!
Cornelia: Then keep your mouth shut and let me handle this!
Abel: This is literally the worst...
Cornelia: Oh? Since when did you become one of the Whitecaps? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were from Athos -
Abel: Just keep driving!

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Gah! Direct hit... You still alive, Abel?
Abel: *groans*
Cornelia: Abel! You okay?
Abel: ...Like tenderized steak.
Cornelia: Still tough enough to sass me, eh? Get moving! The tank's a goner!
Abel: Oh, damn it all... go! I'll grab Sophia!

[Scene change to woods]

Abel: You know, I was contemplating retirement a couple days ago...
Cornelia: Save your energy. Anyone behind us?
Abel: None in sight... Which can't be good.
Cornelia: They've got a tank, and we're desperately trying to escape with a prisoner. The irony is killing -
Abel: Get down!

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Holy shit... that was close.
Abel: Keep your head down. I'm taking a look.
Cornelia: ...
Abel: Seven of them. It's the Guard. We'll be in for a rough fight.
Cornelia: ...Hey, Abel. You sure you don't want to let her go and then run for it?
Abel: Sophia? Like hell!
Cornelia: You might still be able to get away with just a prison sentence if you surrender her.
Abel: Oh, come on. Do you really think that those people are going to just let me off with jail time?
Cornelia: It's a possibility!
Abel: We've already committed to this path, Corny!
Cornelia: But is it worth it? You've worked hard for so long, Abel. To just throw it all away...
Abel: ...I made up my mind when that boy died in my arms, Cornelia.
Cornelia: ...You're a good man, Abel. I don't regret following you one bit. 
Abel: I regret plenty.
Cornelia: Hah... our final stand, then.
Abel: Corny, take the right. We're going to fight them off.
Cornelia: Haha! Alright then, Abel! Let's do this one more time, you and me!

[BATTLE START]

[Battle situation: enemies advance from top of map. Abel and Cornelia use an entrenched position to stay under cover and fire back.]

[WHEN ABEL ATTACKs AN ENEMY FOR THE FIRST TIME:]
Abel: C'mon!

[WHEN CORNELIA ATTACKs AN ENEMY FOR THE FIRST TIME:]
Cornelia: Come and get me!

[TURN 3: Scripted attack from Owen, who spawns under cover behind Abel + Cornelia. He successfully kills an enemy by sniping him]

Abel: A sniper? On our side? Who on earth -
Owen: Captain! Are you alright?
Abel: Owen? What are you doing here? Was that you?
Owen: Err...
Abel: Why can't you stay put like you're told? Oh for God's sake, I specifically told you -
Owen: We couldn't just leave you two...
Abel: "We"?
Owen: ...Me and Emilia.
Abel: Oh, for god's sake -
Owen: I... I'm fighting with you, whether you like it or not! Give me my orders, Captain! I'm getting you out of here alive!
Abel: ...I'm not your Captain anymore, Owen.
Owen: Yes, you are.
Abel: ...
Owen: Your orders?
Abel: ...I'm counting on you, then. Take the rear.
Owen: Yes, sir!

[WHEN OWEN ATTACKs AN ENEMY FOR THE FIRST TIME:]
Owen: Don't hesitate... don't hesitate!

[WHEN EMILIA ATTACKS AN ENEMY FOR THE FIRST TIME]
Emilia: It's about time!

[AFTER ALL ENEMIES ELIMINATED, new ones spawn]

Cornelia: More of them coming in! Oh, there's the tank.
Owen: Wait, what? A tank, too?
Abel: Feel like running yet, Owen?
Cornelia: 10 infantry as well.
Abel: So 10 infantry and a tank.
Owen: 2 more coming from our flank, Captain!
Abel: Right, ok. 12. 
Cornelia: I spot a sniper. Stay under cover.
Abel: 13. How could my day get any better? 
Emilia: There could be 2 tanks. 
Abel: That's reassuring. 
Emilia: Or 3 tanks. 
Abel: ...
Emilia: Or - 
Abel: Alright, alright, I get the point. Owen, support from cover. Corny, suppress them. Em, take my flank. Let's get these bastards. We're going to get out of here.

[BATTLE END]

Cornelia: That's the last of them.
Abel: Hah... If we had done this under orders, we would definitely be swimming in medals.
Cornelia: Well congrats! We're getting bounties instead!
Emilia: I wonder how large they'll be?
Abel: Large enough to have the entire Empire after us.
Cornelia: Well, what now? No transportation, no supplies, and a prisoner to take care of.
Abel: It's just us now.
Cornelia: Us vs the world? How romantic.
Abel: I'm a renegade now. Not your Captain. Are you aware of that, Cornelia? Owen? Emilia?
Owen: Yes. I am.
Emilia: You're not in the wrong, Abel.
Cornelia: We're not leaving, Abel. You're stuck with us now.
Abel: Oh man... If my old man saw me leading you guys, he'd have a fit. 
Cornelia: I don't think his heart would be able to take another one.
Abel: Very funny. But I'm glad you're all here. As for our prisoner, here...

[SOPHIA ENTERS ON RIGHT]

Abel: All right, spill it.
Sophia: You elite forces really do live up to your name.
Abel: Cut the crap. What are you after?
Sophia: Who, me?
Abel: You and [ORG].
Sophia: Can't say.
Abel: Talk or you're gone. We don't have time to mess around.
Sophia: Look, you don't know the whole picture. You're judging pretty quickly -
Abel: I said, "Talk!"
Sophia: Fine, fine. What do you want to know?
Abel: Look where that got me. What is your goal?
Sophia: To bring down the Grohelm Empire.
Abel: Why? You guys supplied us with our tanks. Our guns. This gun.
Sophia: It's for the greater good.
Abel: You call this the greater good? Those dead men over there?
Sophia: Sacrifices have to be made.
Abel: Sacrifices? That's all people are to you? Sacrifices?
Sophia: Everyone's a sacrifice for some greater ideal.
Abel: Why did you kill him? Why did you kill my friend?
Sophia: Which one?
Cornelia: Abel, we need to keep moving. We can question her later.
Abel: ...
Cornelia: Abel.
Abel: Fine. Emilia, take the rear. Owen, keep an eye out for enemy scouts. Cornelia, you're with me. Let's get out of this stinking forest.
