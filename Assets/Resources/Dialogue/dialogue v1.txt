[Scene inside of hovertank]

Abel: Well, finally good news. Skies are clear, and the weather is lovely.
Cornelia: We could use some good news.
Abel: We haven't been getting much lately.
Cornelia: And how many behind us?
Abel: Oh, just one. You know, with the big cannon and all.
Cornelia: They wouldn't fire to kill, would they?
Abel: No idea. I'm not sure if they're too keen on rescuing little Sophia here alive.
Cornelia: Wouldn't they want her back?
Abel: They're willing to assassinate. I hardly think they value lives -

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Gah! Direct hit... well, there's our answer. 
Abel: *groans*
Cornelia: Abel! You OK?
Abel: ...Like tenderized steak.
Cornelia: Your flavor aside, let's move! The tank's a goner! Next shot will be coming soon!
Abel: Ugh, as if things could get any worse... go! I'll grab Sophia!

[Scene change to woods]

Abel: You know, I was contemplating retirement a couple days ago.
Cornelia: You got enough energy to talk, you've got enough to walk. Anyone behind us?
Abel: None in sight... Which can't be good.
Cornelia: They've got a tank, and we're lost in the woods. Funny how things can reverse so quickly, eh?

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Looks like they're here. I count three on this side.
Abel: Four over here. Well, this will be fun.
Cornelia: Totally.
Cornelia: ...Hey, Abel. You sure you don't want to let her go and then run for it?
Abel: Sophia? Like hell. She assassinated the Colonel, did in Eva, and got our own side to try to kill us! Information is the only thing we have left!
Cornelia: You might still be able to get away with a prison sentence if you release her.
Abel: Oh, come on.
Cornelia: It's a possibility.
Abel: I'm not going to pretend we never learned anything.
Cornelia: But is it worth it?
Abel: I made up my mind when I saw that burned village, Cornelia. I knew what we had to do when I held that dying kid in my arms.
Cornelia: Same. I'm glad you feel that way. I don't regret following you one bit. 
Abel: I regret plenty.
Cornelia: So what now? Stand and fight to our last breath?
Abel: Even if they're our old comrades, we can't die here. We're going to stop this war. We'll fight and we'll live.
Cornelia: And Sophia? There's no way we'll be able to secure her against this many men. Should we execute her?
Abel: No. She's helpless now. I'm not giving her the easy way out while she still has to pay for what she did.
Cornelia: An impossible fight then! Haha, what a way to go out! Let's go Abel! You and me, one more time!

[BATTLE START]

[TURN 3]
Abel: A sniper? On our side? Who on earth -
Owen: Captain! Are you alright?
Abel: Owen? What are you doing here? Was that you?
Owen: Err...
Abel: Oh, for god's sake. Why can't you stay put like you're told?
Owen: We couldn't just leave you two...
Abel: "We"?
Owen: ...Me and Emilia.
Abel: Oh, for god's sake -
Owen: I... I'm fighting with you, whether you like it or not! Give me my orders, Captain! I'm getting you out of here alive!
Abel: Hah. I guess there's no convincing you. I'm counting on you, Owen.
Owen: Yes sir!

[AFTER ALL ENEMIES ELIMINATED]

Cornelia: More of them coming in! Oh, there's the tank as well.
Owen: Wait, what? A tank?
Abel: Yes. Coming to finish the job. I guess they really want us dead.
Cornelia: More infantry as well.
Abel: So we have to take out 10 trained soldiers, protect our prisoner, and bring down a tank. 
Owen: I count 12, Captain!
Abel: Right, ok. 12. 
Cornelia: Don't forget the two snipers hiding in the trees. 
Abel: 14. How could my day get any better? 
Emilia: There could be 2 tanks. 
Abel: That's reassuring. 
Emilia: Or 3 tanks. 
Abel: ... 
Emilia: Or - 
Abel: Alright, alright, I get the point. Em, you take my flank. Owen, provide us support from cover. Corn, cover our rear. Let's get these bastards. We're going to get out of here.

[BATTLE END]

Cornelia: That's the last of them.
Abel: Hah... If we had done this in a real battle, we would definitely be swimming in medals.
Cornelia: Well, where do we go? We've got no vehicle and we're dragging around a prisoner of war. Who do we even turn her in to?
Abel: No one. It's just us now. 
Cornelia: Us, and the world...
Abel: Are you aware of that, Cornelia? Owen? Emilia?
Owen: Yes. I am.
Emilia: Could be us against each other. We're not in the wrong, Captain.
Cornelia: We're not leaving, Abel. You're stuck with us now.
Abel: Oh man... If my old man saw me leading you guys, he'd have a fit. 
Cornelia: I don't think his heart would be able to take another one.
Abel: Very funny. But I'm glad you're all here. 
Emilia: What now then, Sir?
Abel: We gather some information while we can.

[SOPHIA ENTERS ON RIGHT]

Abel: There. You can talk now.
Sophia: Wow, you elite forces really do live up to your name.
Abel: Oh, cut the crap. Tell us what you know about this [ORG].
Sophia: [ORG]? What's that?
Abel: The reason you'll get shot if you don't talk.
Sophia: Then I wouldn't be able to talk, would I?
Abel: Oh, for god's sake. You have until three. One... two...
Sophia: Why three?
Abel: Because that's how many damns I can give before I pull the trigger.
Sophia: That's a lot!
Abel: Talk. Now.
Sophia: Fine, fine. You really should lighten up more.
Abel: Look where that got me. What is your goal?
Sophia: To bring down the Grohelm Empire.
Abel: Why? You guys supplied us with our tanks. Our guns. This gun.
Sophia: We hoped that you guys would shoot yourselves. Humans are pretty good at that.
Abel: And if you keep shooting your mouth, your face is coming with it. Why did you kill Colonel Treas?
Sophia: He found out, so we got rid of him.
Abel: You bastards would go that far...
Sophia: Don't you do the same everyday you go out to fight? You just shot down brave men who were just following orders, you know.
Abel: That's true. But I'm not one who will blindly follow orders. 
Sophia: And now look at what you did. What are you going to tell their families? Their kids?
Abel: That the responsibility lies on me. I'm not going to let [ORG] or whatever tear apart innocent lives.
Cornelia: Abel, we should keep moving. We can question her later.
Abel: Fine. But we're going to get to the bottom of this. And when we find out why this group is intent on reducing Grohelm to dust, we're going to teach them a lesson.
