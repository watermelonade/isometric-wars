[Scene inside of hovertank]

Abel: Well, finally good news. Skies are clear, and the weather is lovely.
Cornelia: And how many behind us?
Abel: Oh, just one. You know, with the big cannon that can blow us to kingdom come.
Cornelia: They wouldn't fire to kill, would they?
Abel: No idea. I'm not sure if they're too keen on rescuing little Sophia here alive or dead.

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Gah! Direct hit... well, there's our answer. Abel! You OK?
Abel: ...Like tenderized steak.
Cornelia: Your flavor aside, let's move! The tank's a goner! Next shot will be coming soon!
Abel: Ugh, as if things could get any worse... go, go! I'll grab Sophia!

[Scene change to woods]

Abel: And to think that I was contemplating retirement a couple days ago.
Cornelia: You got enough energy to talk, you've got enough to walk. Anyone behind us?
Abel: None in sight. Which can't be good.
Cornelia: They've got a tank, and we're lost in the woods. Funny how things can reverse so quickly, eh?
Abel: Hey, I know exactly where we ar-
Cornelia: Heads up!

[Explosion rocks the screen]

Cornelia: Looks like they're here. I count three on this side.
Abel: Four over here. Well, this will be fun.
Cornelia: Totally.
Cornelia: ...Hey, Abel. You sure you don't want to let her go and then run for it?
Abel: Sophia? Like hell. She assassinated the Colonel, did in Eva, and got our own side to try to kill us!
Cornelia: You might still be able to get away with a prison sentence if you release her.
Abel: Oh, come on.
Cornelia: It's a possibility.
Abel: I'm not going to pretend we never learned anything.
Cornelia: Hah! You never cease to amaze me. I don't regret following you one bit. 
Abel: I sure do.
Cornelia: So what now? Stand and fight to our last breath?
Abel: ...No. Even if they're our old comrades, we can't die here. We're going to stop this war.
Cornelia: And Sophia? There's no way we'll be able to secure her against this many men. Should we execute her?
Abel: No. She's helpless now. I'm not gunning her down when she still has to pay for what she did.
Cornelia: An impossible fight then! Haha, what a way to go out! Let's go Abel! You and me, one last time!

[BATTLE START]

[TURN 3]
Abel: A sniper? On our side? Who on earth -
Owen: Captain! Are you alright?
Abel: Owen? What are you doing here? If you tell me that you're the one who shot him...
Owen: Err...
Abel: Oh, for god's sake. Why can't you stay put like you're told?
Owen: We couldn't just leave you two...
Abel: "We"?
Owen: Me and Emilia.
Abel: Oh, for god's sake -
Owen: ...We're fighting with you, whether you like it or not! Give us our orders, Captain! We're getting you out of here alive!
Abel: ...I guess there's no convincing you. I'm counting on you, Owen.
Owen: Yes sir!

[AFTER ALL ENEMIES ELIMINATED]

Cornelia: More of them coming in! They've brought along the tank as well!
Owen: Wait, what? A tank?
Abel: Yes. You know, sits down and goes *bangbang* until we're all dead?
Cornelia: More infantry as well.
Abel: So we have to take out 10 of our former friends, protect our prisoner, and bring down a tank. 
Owen: Actually, I think there's 12 of them... 
Abel: Right, ok. 12. 
Cornelia: Don't forget the two snipers probably hiding in the trees. 
Abel: 14. How could my day get any better? 
Emilia: There could be 2 tanks. 
Abel: That's reassuring. 
Emilia: Or 3 tanks. 
Abel: ... 
Emilia: Or - 
Abel: Alright, alright, I get the point. Em, you take my flank. Owen, provide us support from cover. Cor, cover our rear. Let's get these bastards. We're going to get out of here.

[BATTLE END]

Cornelia: That's the last of them.
Abel: We've escaped for now.
Cornelia: Well, where do we go? We've got no vehicle and we're dragging around a prisoner of war. Who do we even turn her in to?
Abel: No one. It's just us now. Are you aware of that, Cornelia? Owen? Emilia?
Owen: Yes. I am.
Emilia: Just the way I like it.
Cornelia: We're not leaving, Abel. You're stuck with us now.
Abel: Oh man... If my old man saw me leading you guys, he'd have a fit. Anyways, I guess we might as well gather some information while we can.

[SOPHIA ENTERS ON RIGHT]

Abel: There. You can talk now.
Sophia: Nice weather we're having!
Abel: Oh, cut the crap. Tell us what you know about this [ORG].
Sophia: [ORG]? What's that?
Abel: The reason you'll get shot if you don't talk.
Sophia: Not telling~
Abel: Oh, for god's sake. You have until three. One... two...
Sophia: Why three?
Abel: Because that's how many damns I give about you before I pull the trigger.
Sophia: Seven's a better number. Or how about seventy?
Abel: Talk. Now.
Sophia: Fine, fine. What do you want to know about us?
Abel: What is your goal?
Sophia: To bring down the Grohelm Empire.
Abel: Why? You guys supplied us with our tanks. Our guns. This gun.
Sophia: We hoped with your intelligence, you'd shoot yourselves on accident.
Abel: Keep shooting your mouth, and your face is coming with it. Why did you kill Colonel Treas?
Sophia: He found out. So we got rid of him.
Abel: You bastards would go that far...
Sophia: Don't you do the same everyday you go out to fight? You basically just shot down over 15 people who were just following orders, you know.
Abel: That's true. But I'm not one who will blindly follow orders. That's what you guys want, isn't it? For us to keep our heads down and go with the crowd.
Cornelia: Abel, we should keep moving. We can question her later.
Abel: Fine. But we're going to get to the bottom of this. And when we find out why this group is intent on reducing Grohelm to dust, we're going to teach them a lesson.
